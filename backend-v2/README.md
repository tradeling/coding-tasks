# Tradeling Backend Coding Challenge


## Task:  Voucher Pool
The objective is to create a voucher pool microservice based in NodeJs. You can use whichever  libraries you prefer. The service should expose a ​REST API​.

A voucher pool is a collection of voucher codes that can be used by customers to get discounts on website. Each code may only be used once, and we would like to know when it was used by the customer. Since there can be many customers in a voucher pool, we need a call that auto-generates voucher codes for each customer. Here’s a screenshot to give you an idea what it looks like:

### Entities
* Customer
	*	Name
	*	Email (unique)
*	Special Offer
	*	Name
	*	Fixed percentage discount
*	Voucher Code
	*	Unique randomly generated Code (at least 8 chars)
	*	Assigned to a Customer and a special offer
	*	Expiration Date
	*	Can just be used once
	*	Should track date of usage

### Functionalities
* Generate Voucher Code for each customer for a given Special Offer and expiration data
* Provide an endpoint, reachable via HTTP, which receives a Voucher Code and Email and
validates the Voucher Code. In Case it is valid, return the Percentage Discount and set the
date of usage
* For a given Email return all its valid Voucher Codes with the Name of the Special Offer

### Tasks
* [ ] Design a database schema
* [ ] Write an application
* [ ] API endpoint for verifying and redeeming vouchers
* [ ] Write unit tests
* [ ] A nice little Readme on how to run
* [ ] ***PLUS POINT:*** Using Typescript
* [ ] ***PLUS POINT:*** Writing swagger for the API
* [ ] ***PLUS POINT:*** Docker file to setup the whole application with all the dependencies (database, nodejs)
